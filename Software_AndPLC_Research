Programming cable: RS232. Need a Serial-To-USB adapter! 
  NEED A MALE-MALE ADAPTER ARRRGH

For the voltage supply plug marked X9: 
  One wire takes 12 V DC ... 58 V DC (Marked as "ZK+")
    This is the power supply wire. 
    Nom
  The wire marked "24 V" takes 24 V DC, +/- 20%.
    This is for the logic supply
    Nominal current is 0.2 A, max current is 1.5 A
  The third wire takes 0 V. 
  
  Here is the schematic for how the power supplies should be connected: https://i.gyazo.com/7dfdc3f8f0198977ac42964e5fa1cf2e.png
