1: Wiring everything up: 
  1A: Connecting the motor cables:
    There are two cables that connect the EMMS-ST motors with the CMMS-ST motor controller. 
    One cable has a 9-pin connector that goes into the motor, and the other has a PS2-like connector. 
    Plug the cables into their respective plugs, marked as X2 and X6 on the controller. Where the cables go should be clear by their connectors
  
  1B: Digital I/O:
    Plug in the cable with the green, white, brown and yellow wires into the controller's X1 port.
    
  1C: Power Supply:
    The CMMS-ST requires a 24V AND 48V input to function properly, routed through its X9 port. 
    The input marked as "ZK+" requires 48V. It supplies the motors, so expect it to consume slightly over 2 amps at its maximum load.
    The input marked as "24 V" requires 24V. It is the logic supply. The nominal current is 0.2A, but the max current is rated at 1.5A.
    The input marked as "0 V" should be wired to the negative of both power supplies. 
    In addition, the green, white and brown wires from the digital I/O cable should be hooked up along the 24V cable. 
      They need to be recieving 24V for the motors to be enabled.

2: Communicating to the controller:
  2A: The most direct way to communicate with a CMMS-ST is through its serial port. 
    Since most computers don't have a serial port any more, a nullmodem serial to USB adapter is needed.
    I have personally used the following adapter with success: https://www.newegg.com/Product/NewProduct.aspx?Item=N82E16812400121&RandomID=84985244794020180115120300
    Note that not all adapters may work.
    After plugging in the connector, you will likely have to update the drivers for it: 
      Go to Device Manager -> "Ports (COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port" -> right click and select "Update Driver"
  2B: Installing the software: 
    You will need the Festo Configuration Tool (FCT) to communicate with and program the CMMS-ST.
    This can be downloaded for free on this link: Note that this specific plugin must be installed, no other versions of FCT will work:
      https://www.festo.com/net/sl_si/SupportPortal/default.aspx?cat=1530&tab=4 Click on "FCT - Festo Configuration Tool" and download the latest version.
    After installing, open it
    TODO: Process for working inside the FCT and moving the motor.
